The following document will outline the database management system for our shoe retailer/wholesaler. The system is designed to address key pain points, produce actionable reports and facilitate transactions. This business sells to retailers (B2B) as well as to consumers (B2C) directly. The system reflects purchase orders, products and inventory on the one hand, as well as sales, on the other. Like any retail business, you need to manage inventory, re-ordering of stock and adding new product releases to the offers. Furthermore, it is important for strategy and marketing to have an insight to the performance of individual products, segments and of the sales representatives selling them. Each process can be accompanied and tied into the database, from ordering to order picking and informing the customer of the estimated arrival date. In a data-driven business, the management is able to steer sales, based on historic data and performance. The database will cater to all of these needs and in the following, we will outline how it will do so, more specifically.
